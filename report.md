## 1. Executive Summary

**Manim Motion Editor** is a Figma-like browser-based animation editor that generates Manim CE Python code and renders HQ video via Docker. It fills a massive gap in the Manim ecosystem — the community has been asking for a visual editor for years, and no existing tool provides true drag-and-drop animation creation with Manim rendering.

### Strengths
- Visually polished dark-theme UI with a professional feel
- Full Docker stack (web, API, renderer, Redis queue) — one-command setup
- Real-time 60fps preview with morph interpolation
- Bidirectional code view (generate code from canvas, parse code back to canvas)
- 15 shape types, 17 easing functions, 11 entrance + 9 exit animations
- Multi-track timeline with draggable, resizable clips
- Server-side Manim rendering with progress tracking and video download

### Key Gaps
- **No LaTeX/math support** — the #1 reason people use Manim
- **No undo/redo** — critical for any editor
- **No keyframe animation** — only clip-based; no per-property keyframes
- **No camera controls** — zoom, pan, focus animations are core Manim features
- **No graph/plot/coordinate system support** — the second most popular Manim use case
- **No audio/voiceover support** — a top community request
- **No 3D scene support** — Manim's ThreeDScene is heavily used
- **No templates or presets** — users need starting points
- **Limited text capabilities** — no LaTeX, no letter-by-letter animation, no MathTex

## 5. What the Community Wants

Based on research across GitHub Discussions, Issues, Reddit, and the broader Manim community:

### Top 10 Community Requests (Ranked by Frequency)

1. **Interactive/real-time preview** — Users are tired of write-render-review cycles. They want to see changes instantly. *The editor already addresses this, which is a huge advantage.*

2. **LaTeX/math formula support** — This is the #1 reason people use Manim. An editor without LaTeX support misses the primary audience.

3. **Voiceover/audio sync** — `manim-voiceover` is a popular plugin. Users want to sync animations to narration, add background music, and control timing via audio cues.

4. **Graph and plot creation** — Coordinate systems, function plots, and number lines are the second most common Manim use case after text/formulas.

5. **Camera animations** — Zoom to detail, pan across scenes, and focus animations are heavily used in educational content.

6. **Checkpoint/state management** — Users want to jump to any point in their animation without re-rendering from the start. The editor's timeline scrubbing partially addresses this.

7. **Template library** — Beginners want starting points. "Explain a theorem," "show a graph transformation," "introduce a formula" — pre-built scene templates would dramatically lower the barrier.

8. **Undo/redo** — Every serious editor needs this. It's conspicuously absent.

9. **Path animation / motion paths** — Moving objects along curves (Bezier, arc, custom path) rather than just point-to-point.

10. **Collaboration / sharing** — Share projects via URL, export to different formats, embed in presentations.

### Pain Points Users Report

- **Slow render cycles** — Fixed by the editor's live preview
- **Steep learning curve** — Fixed by visual drag-and-drop
- **Coordinate system confusion** — Manim's coordinate space vs. pixel space is confusing; the editor abstracts this nicely
- **Asset management** — Placing images correctly in Manim is tedious; the editor handles this well
- **Animation sequencing** — Getting timing right between multiple animations is trial-and-error; the timeline helps enormously

## 7. Recommended Improvements — Priority Tiers

### Tier 1: Critical (Do These First)

#### 1.1 Undo/Redo System
- **Impact:** Foundational for any serious editor
- **Approach:** Command pattern with action stack; store snapshots of project state or diff-based undo
- **Scope:** Every action in `actions.*` needs to push to the undo stack
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Keyboard:** Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z

#### 1.2 LaTeX / MathTex Support
- **Impact:** Unlocks the #1 Manim use case
- **Approach:** 
  - Add a "LaTeX" shape type in the sidebar
  - User types LaTeX in properties panel (e.g., `E = mc^2`)
  - Client-side preview using KaTeX or MathJax (render to SVG in browser)
  - Manim codegen emits `MathTex("E = mc^2")`
  - Support `TransformMatchingTex` for formula transformations
- **Data model:** New object type `latex` with `content`, `fontSize`, `color` properties
- **Effort:** Medium-High

#### 1.3 Copy / Paste / Duplicate Objects
- **Impact:** Basic editor operation everyone expects
- **Approach:** Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V/Ctrl+D with position offset
- **Scope:** Objects, clips, and groups
- **Effort:** Low

#### 1.4 Graph / Coordinate System Support
- **Impact:** Unlocks the #2 Manim use case
- **Approach:**
  - New object types: `axes`, `number_line`, `number_plane`
  - Configurable range, labels, tick marks
  - "Add Function" button to plot `f(x)` expressions
  - Properties panel: x_range, y_range, axis labels, grid on/off
  - Manim codegen: `Axes(x_range=[-3,3], y_range=[-2,2])`, `axes.plot(lambda x: x**2)`
- **Effort:** High

#### 1.5 Improved Text Capabilities
- **Impact:** Text is in every animation
- **Additions needed:**
  - Letter-by-letter entrance animation (preview + codegen for `AddTextLetterByLetter`)
  - Word-by-word entrance animation
  - TypeWriter effect (maps to `TypeWithCursor`)
  - Multi-line text with line spacing
  - Text color per-character (rich text)
  - Inline code view for text content
- **Effort:** Medium

---

### Tier 2: High Priority

#### 2.1 Keyframe Animation System
- **Impact:** Industry standard for animation; replaces the current clip-only model
- **Approach:**
  - Per-property keyframes on the timeline (x, y, width, height, rotation, opacity, fill, etc.)
  - Diamond markers on timeline tracks
  - Bezier curve easing between keyframes (visual curve editor)
  - Auto-key mode: changes to properties auto-create keyframes at playhead position
- **Effort:** High (requires timeline refactor)

#### 2.2 Camera / Viewport Animations
- **Impact:** Core storytelling tool for educational content
- **Approach:**
  - Virtual camera object on the timeline
  - Camera zoom, pan, and focus keyframes
  - "Focus on object" action (zoom camera to selected object)
  - Manim codegen: `self.camera.frame.animate.move_to(obj).set(width=8)`
- **Preview:** Apply camera transform to the stage viewport during playback
- **Effort:** Medium-High

#### 2.3 Path Animation / Motion Paths
- **Impact:** Objects moving along curves is extremely common
- **Approach:**
  - New clip type: `path`
  - Visual path editor: click to add control points, drag Bezier handles
  - Show path as a dotted line on stage during editing
  - Manim codegen: `MoveAlongPath(obj, path)`
- **Effort:** Medium-High

#### 2.4 Audio / Voiceover Track
- **Impact:** Top community request for educational content
- **Approach:**
  - Audio track in timeline (waveform visualization)
  - Upload audio files (MP3, WAV)
  - Snap animation clips to audio markers/bookmarks
  - Manim codegen: uses `manim-voiceover` plugin or manual audio overlay
  - Optional TTS integration (API endpoint)
- **Effort:** High

#### 2.5 Template Library
- **Impact:** Dramatically lowers barrier for new users
- **Examples:**
  - "Theorem Proof" — title, statement, proof steps with sequential reveal
  - "Function Graph" — axes, function plot, area highlight
  - "Shape Transform" — two shapes with morph animation
  - "Comparison" — side-by-side objects with labels
  - "Title Card" — animated title with subtitle
  - "Number Line" — point moving along a number line
  - "Matrix Operation" — matrix multiplication visualization
- **Approach:** Pre-built project JSON files loaded from a gallery
- **Effort:** Medium

#### 2.6 Animation Composition (Parallel & Staggered)
- **Impact:** Users need simultaneous and staggered animations constantly
- **Approach:**
  - Allow overlapping clips on the same track (run in parallel)
  - "Stagger" option: automatically offset clips by a configurable delay
  - Manim codegen: `AnimationGroup()`, `LaggedStart()`, `Succession()`
- **Effort:** Medium

---

### Tier 3: Important (Quality of Life)

#### 3.1 Object Locking & Visibility Toggle
- Lock objects to prevent accidental moves
- Hide objects temporarily without deleting them
- Eye icon and lock icon in timeline object bars

#### 3.2 Rulers, Guides, and Smart Snapping

- Distance indicators when dragging

#### 3.3 Color Gradient Support
- Linear and radial gradients for fills
- Gradient animation (color sweep)
- Manim codegen: `color=color_gradient([RED, BLUE], length)`

#### 3.4 Attention / Emphasis Animations
- New clip types: `indicate`, `flash`, `circumscribe`, `wiggle`
- Preview: brief scale-up + highlight
- Manim codegen: `Indicate(obj)`, `Flash(obj)`, `Circumscribe(obj)`

#### 3.5 Dashed / Styled Lines
- Dash pattern control for lines, arrows, shapes
- Line cap styles (round, butt, square)
- Manim codegen: `DashedLine()`, `DashedVMobject()`

#### 3.6 Export Format Options
- Export as GIF (via API: `manim --format gif`)
- Export as WebM
- Export as PNG sequence
- Export as Lottie JSON (for web embedding)
- Configurable FPS and resolution in export dialog

#### 3.7 Scene Sections / Chapters

## 8. UX & Design Improvements

### 8.1 Critical UX Fixes

| Issue | Current State | Recommended Fix |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **No undo/redo** | Users can't recover from mistakes | Command pattern undo stack (Tier 1) |
| **No copy/paste** | Must recreate objects from scratch | Ctrl+C/V/D support |
| **No multi-select drag** | Can multi-select but not drag together | Group drag for multi-selection |
| **Timeline scrub precision** | Time display shows 1 decimal | Add frame-level precision, snap to clip edges |
| **No onboarding** | Empty canvas with minimal hint | Interactive tutorial overlay for first-time users |
| **Tiny click targets** | Some buttons/controls are very small (8-9px text) | Minimum 10px text, 28px touch targets |
| **No confirmation on destructive actions** | Delete object has no undo | With undo, this becomes safe; without it, add confirmation |
| **Text editing** | Must use properties panel | Double-click for inline editing on canvas |
| **Clip overlap** | No visual warning for overlapping clips | Color-code conflicts, show overlap indicator |

### 8.2 UX Enhancements

- **Contextual toolbar**: Show relevant actions near the selection (like Figma's floating toolbar)
- **Mini-map**: Small overview of the full canvas when zoomed in
- **Object search**: Find objects by name when the project gets complex
- **Keyboard shortcut cheat sheet**: `?` key to show all shortcuts
- **Drag selection box**: Click-drag on empty canvas to box-select multiple objects
- **Snapping feedback**: Show snap lines and distance while dragging
- **Animation preview thumbnail**: Hover over a clip to see a mini-preview
- **Recent colors palette**: Remember last 10 used colors
- **Numeric input scrubbing**: Click-drag on number inputs to scrub values (like After Effects)
- **Right-click context menu**: Cut, copy, paste, duplicate, group, align, bring to front/back
- **Auto-save**: Periodic auto-save to localStorage with recovery prompt

### 8.3 Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for all panels
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
- ARIA labels on icon-only buttons
- Color contrast: ensure all text meets WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 ratio)
- Screen reader support for the object list and timeline

---

## 9. Technical Debt & Code Quality

### 9.1 Framework Upgrade: Vue 2 → Vue 3
- **Why:** Vue 2 reached end-of-life on December 31, 2023. No security patches.
- **Impact:** The entire frontend uses Vue 2.7 + Options API
- **Recommendation:** Migrate to Vue 3 with Composition API. This also unlocks better TypeScript support and modern ecosystem tools.
- **Effort:** High but necessary for long-term maintenance

### 9.2 State Management
- **Current:** `Vue.observable()` global store — works but isn't scalable
- **Issue:** No action middleware, no devtools support, no persistence layer
- **Recommendation:** Migrate to Pinia (Vue 3) or Vuex for debugging, time-travel, and plugin support
- **Benefit:** Undo/redo becomes trivial with proper state management

### 9.3 TypeScript Migration
- **Current:** 100% JavaScript with no type annotations
- **Issue:** As the codebase grows, refactoring becomes risky without types
- **Recommendation:** Gradual TypeScript migration, starting with the engine and store
- **Effort:** Medium (can be incremental)

### 9.4 Code Duplication
- **Issue:** `services/web/src/export/manim.js` and `services/api/src/compiler/codegen.js` are nearly identical (~370 lines duplicated)
- **Recommendation:** Extract shared codegen logic into a package or shared module
- **Approach:** Create `packages/manim-codegen/` as a shared dependency, or use a build step to share code

### 9.5 Test Coverage
- **Current:** 30+ assertions in `tests/engine.test.mjs` covering easing, resampling, timeline scheduling, blending
- **Missing:** No tests for the Manim exporter/parser, no API route tests, no component tests, no E2E tests
- **Recommendation:**
  - Add exporter round-trip tests (generate → parse → compare)
  - Add API integration tests (supertest)
  - Add component tests (Vue Test Utils)
  - Add E2E tests (Playwright or Cypress)

### 9.6 Error Handling
- **Current:** Errors show as a toast at the bottom; render errors show in the dialog
- **Missing:** No error boundaries in components, no structured error logging, no Sentry-like monitoring
- **Recommendation:** Add Vue error handler, structured logging in API, optional error reporting

### 9.7 Performance Concerns
- **Playback engine:** The `computeFrame` method iterates all tracks and clips every frame. For complex projects (50+ clips), this could cause frame drops.
- **Recommendation:** Spatial/temporal indexing for clips (binary search by time range), pre-compute active clip sets when project changes
- **Points cache:** The `_pointsCache` in PlaybackEngine is never invalidated when objects resize — only object type is part of the cache key (width and height ARE included, which is good, but the cache grows unbounded)
- **Recommendation:** Add cache size limit (LRU eviction)

### 9.8 Security
- **API has no authentication** — anyone on the network can CRUD projects, upload files, trigger renders
- **No rate limiting** — render endpoint can be hammered
- **No input sanitization** for text content (XSS in SVGs, text injection in generated Python)
- **50MB upload limit** is set but no server-wide storage quota
- **Recommendation:** Add optional auth (JWT or API key), rate limit render endpoint, sanitize text content for Python codegen, add storage quotas

### 9.9 Docker / Infrastructure
- **No health check** for the renderer service
- **No resource limits** on renderer container (could consume all RAM/CPU during 4K renders)
- **No render timeout** exposed to user (hardcoded 10 minutes)
- **No horizontal scaling** — single renderer worker
- **Recommendation:** Add Docker health checks, resource limits, configurable timeout, optional multi-worker support

## 10. Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Type | Strengths | Weaknesses vs. This Editor |
|------|------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Manim Editor** (official) | Post-processor | Presentation slides, section API | No visual creation, code-only |
| **Graf** | GUI for Manim | GUI for Manim creation | Limited documentation, unclear activity |
| **Motion Canvas** | TypeScript animation | LaTeX, code blocks, audio sync | No Manim output, no Python, different ecosystem |
| **Remotion** | React video framework | React components, powerful rendering | No Manim, requires React knowledge, commercial license |
| **Lottie Creator** | Web animation | Professional UI, keyframes, SVG import | No Manim, no math focus, commercial |
| **After Effects** | Desktop animation | Industry standard, plugins, expressions | Expensive, desktop-only, no Manim |
| **This Editor** | Visual Manim editor | **Only visual editor that generates real Manim code**, Docker rendering, live preview, open source | Gaps listed in this report |

### Unique Selling Points to Protect and Amplify
1. **The only visual editor that outputs real Manim Python** — this is the moat
2. **Bidirectional code view** — edit visually OR edit code, both ways
3. **One-click Docker rendering** — no local Manim install needed
4. **Free and open source** — no license restrictions

## Appendix B: Manim Codegen Gaps

The following Manim features are used in the codegen but have nuances that could be improved:

1. **Easing mapping is lossy** — Several editor easings map to the same Manim `rate_functions.smooth`. The editor has 17 easings but Manim has different ones. Need to expand the `EASING_MAP` to cover more Manim rate functions.

2. **No parallel animation support in codegen** — All animations are sequential (`self.play()` one at a time). Need `AnimationGroup()` support for overlapping clips.

3. **No `self.play()` with multiple animations** — Manim supports `self.play(anim1, anim2)` for simultaneous animations. The codegen only emits one animation per `self.play()`.

4. **Heart shape codegen uses ParametricFunction** — This works but produces a wireframe. Should use `SVGMobject` or a filled polygon approach for better rendering.

5. **Parser is regex-based** — The Manim code parser (`parseManimScript`) uses line-by-line regex matching. This is fragile and breaks on multi-line statements, comments, or unusual formatting. Consider using a proper AST parser or at minimum handle multi-line continuations.

6. **No `wait_until` or conditional timing** — The codegen uses fixed `self.wait()` between animations. Manim supports event-driven timing that could be useful.

## Appendix C: Community Quotes & Signals

> "An interactive mode where developers can run code snippets and see immediate output" — GitHub Discussion #3954

> "Automatic checkpoint creation for every line rather than just comment-marked lines" — 3b1b/manim Issue #2306

> "Dynamic axis range animation for plots and number planes" — ManimCommunity/manim Issue #3804

> "Pre-recorded audio support... easily swap and use pre-recorded audio files" — manim-voiceover Issue #100

> "Manim lacks a live preview feature, significantly hindering development workflow" — Community comparison

These quotes confirm that the editor's live preview is its strongest differentiator, and that math/LaTeX + audio are the most impactful features to add next.
